# Interactive-Div-Moving :
 You'll be able to control the movement of three div elements on the webpage using your keyboard. Use the arrow keys or the buttons from the form to navigate them around the screen, making them dance to your command. The div elements also respond on mouse clicks, so wherever you click on the screen - the div will follow your mouse and position at the center :) The coordinates of the active div by X and Y are always shown and you can get the div elements to their initial state by pressing "H".
# Shape Transformation:
One of the most intriguing features of this project is the ability to transform the active div into different shapes. By pressing the 'C' key, you can magically change the shape of the div into a perfect circle, and by pressing "S" you turn it back to a square.
# Key Commands:
I've implemented intuitive keyboard commands for div selection, movement, and shape transformation. Use keys like 'r' (to activate the red div), 'g' ((to activate the green div), and 'b'(to activate the blue div) to select the div you want to control. This means you can focus your attention on one div at a time or manipulate multiple divs as you see fit.
# Drag And Drop
You can drag every div element anywhere you like. 
# JavaScript Magic: 
All these features come to life thanks to JavaScript, which handles the logic behind the div movements and shape transformations. Dive into the code to understand the mechanics behind this project.
